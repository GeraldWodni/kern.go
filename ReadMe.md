# kern.go

Web-framework for web-applications. The [biggest implementation of kern is currently written for node.js](https://github.com/GeraldWodni/kern.js).

As I needed a better framework for developing kubernetes controllers, I decided to start this minimalistic port.


## Demo

A simple demo application can be found in the [demo-repository](https://github.com/GeraldWodni/kern.go-demo)
